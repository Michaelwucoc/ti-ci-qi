Have you ever heard of Murphy’s Law? “If something can go wrong, it will.” I used to think that this line sounded a bit pessimistic. And one day, I learned its meaning the hard way… on a terrifyingly steep ski slope.													
This is the story I want to share today: a story about fear, losing control, and facing it anyway.
Last winter break, I picked up a completely new sport— skiing.
Skiing is a sport where you strap both feet onto a pair of long, thin boards and quite literally fly across the snow. When you’re just starting out, controlling the skis feels almost impossible. Once you start gliding downhill, the skis speed up beyond your control. The world blurs past as if someone has pressed the fast-forward button— the trees, the fences, the slope, all rush straight at you.

The fear isn’t just psychological. It’s instinctive. Your body reflexively wants to brake, to stop, to grab hold of something solid.
But that’s the problem— when fear makes you try to “control” everything, Murphy’s Law kicks in.												
The more afraid you are of falling, the stiffer your body becomes. The stiffer your body becomes, the more your skis slip out of control, and the more likely you are to fall. The harder you try to slow down, the harder you crash. Learning to ski is basically being trapped in a cycle of “fear → trying to control things → losing control → and then falling,” over and over again.
My own accident happened during the last run of the day.
The sun had almost completely set. I took the lift up for one final practice, but at the mountain’s halfway point, the lifts stopped operating for the day. I was stranded. And the only way down was an advanced slope far beyond my level. The wind cut across my face like a blade. In front of me was a nearly vertical slope— silent, intimidating, and completely deserted.
At that moment, I felt like I was standing on the edge of a cliff with only two choices: call for rescue, or ski down on my own. Ultimately, I chose to take the risk—partly to save my dignity, and partly because I simply didn’t have the courage to call for ski patrol while wearing full gear. And honestly… I was already there. I took a deep breath. If I was going to fall anyway, I might as well go all in.
Then, a miracle happened. Although the speed was slipping out of my control, my body was moving in rhythm. My skis and I, somehow, fell into sync. The dramatic disaster I had pictured… tumbling down with flailing limbs, never came. Instead, I was skiing surprisingly smoothly. Suddenly, the wind, the speed, and the snow, weren’t my enemies anymore. They had become my partners.
I wasn’t afraid of losing control anymore or crashing to my death.
When I reached the bottom, I checked my speed tracker— and I had just broken my personal record. I had overtaken the version of myself who was always afraid.
Life, I realized, is a lot like skiing. When responsibilities pile up, it feels like someone is pushing you from behind, forcing you to go faster. The more you try to make everything “perfect” and “fully under control,” the more tense and exhausted you become— just like how the more you want to brake on a slope, the more your skis seem to suddenly stop working. 
I’ve slowly come to understand that what really wears us out isn’t often the task itself, but our obsession with “I must control this quickly” and “I must get everything right.”
Once I started slowing down my pace and working with my abilities to move forward, step by step, the anxiety began to fade.
On the slopes, the moment right before losing control is often where the breakthrough begins.
In life, accepting that we can’t control everything is often where change starts—and facing challenges calmly is where growth begins.
Of course, I still get scared. But now, I can live with that fear. I still want to run away sometimes, but now I have the courage to get back up and keep going.
I hope all of you can find the courage to stand without flinching and face your fears when you’re about to lose control, and to meet a stronger version of yourself. 
Thank you.
