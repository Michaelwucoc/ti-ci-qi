When I was thirteen, I mastered a kind of magic—the ability to disappear.
Before then, I never imagined I could become invisible in front of people who once knew me so well.
I used to have two very close friends, and we entered the same middle school together.
Seventh grade was the happiest time of my entire middle school life. The three of us squeezed together between classes, whispering inside jokes only we understood. Sometimes, a single glance was enough for us to burst into laughter. I still remember one afternoon after school. We stopped by a convenience store, bought one ice cream each, clinked them together like a toast, laughing all the way home until our stomachs hurt. The sunset stretched our shadows long across the pavement, and I thought quietly to myself:
“We’ll be best friends for life.”
But in eighth grade, I slowly realized— maybe I was the only one still holding onto that vision of us. The two of them went out together many times during the holidays.
I only found out long after school started, through someone else’s casual remark.

One day, the three of us were walking together, while they linked arms, chatting, and laughing about a topic the three of us once loved. I thought the moment had come— I could join in naturally, just like before. So I added a sentence to their conversation.
That’s when my “invisibility” spell activated.
They exchanged a glance, suddenly quickened their pace, and walked past me. No response. Not even a look. At that moment, in the bustling hallway, I was the only one who stood frozen, my cheeks burning. 

But I wasn’t ready to give up yet. I just wanted an answer.
A few days later, I gathered all my courage.
“Wait!” I called out, running up to them. My voice was shaking. “I just want to know… why did you suddenly stop talking to me? Why? Please tell me. If it’s my fault, I’ll change.”
They froze for a second. The girl who had known me the longest sneered and said,
“Do we need a reason?” Then she grabbed the other girl’s hand and they walked away from me. Recalling the past moments we shared, and thinking of how things had taken such a sudden downturn, I felt my throat was tightened. 
That night, I went home, sat on the edge of my bed holding a stuffed toy, and cried so hard that I couldn’t breathe. 
My mom sat beside me, gently patting my back, listening to every broken sentence that tumbled out. She poured out words of comfort and concern, and some words I completely didn’t understand at the time. She told me that I was like a mirror— always busy reflecting other people’s light, hoping that by doing so I could stand in the brightness with them to be seen and cherished. But if I chose to be a mirror, the moment someone else’s light moved away, I would fall into darkness. My mom told me to stop being a mirror and to become my own light.
But I was fourteen, her words felt too abstract, and I couldn’t understand.
So the fourteenth year of my life became a cycle of running into the same wall.
I tried to fit in.
Failed.
Went silent for a few days.
Tried again.
Failed again. I felt that I had been thrown into the darkest corner of the world—alone, helpless, not knowing what to do.
But it was also during those days of being forgotten that I did something I thought was trivial.
I wrote my first diary entry ever.
It was actually just two sentences copied from the internet:
“You live to be yourself, not to explain yourself.”
“The meaning of life lies in experience.”
And at the end, I casually added the sentence I still didn’t understand:
“Be your own light.”
I began learning how to communicate with myself. I would stand on the balcony, letting the wind brush against my face. Sometimes it was a soft breeze, sometimes it was a strong gust— each one felt like it was sweeping away the pressure from my body. When the rain fell on my face, I didn’t hide. It felt like the rain was washing away all of my grievances. When sunlight warmed my back, I felt a strength rising from within.
I refocused on my love for dance. Whenever I had free time, I would turn the music up as loud as I could and practice in front of the mirror again and again. Not to impress anyone, and not to prove anything—simply because in the moment I moved, I could feel a surge of energy rising from deep inside me. Sweat soaked my hair and ran down my forehead, yet all I felt was exhilaration. In those moments, I was immersed entirely in my own rhythm, my own joy. I was one hundred percent free.
In those moments when I didn’t need to say anything, and I didn’t have to care about others’ opinions, it suddenly became clear to me: I wasn’t invisible.
At least, not to myself. Even without friends beside me, I wasn’t living in shadows.
Had I become my own glimmer of light? I didn’t know. And then I turned fifteen.
Entering high school — a new environment, new classmates — I was fortunate to meet many sincere and warm-hearted friends and get rid of the gloom in junior high school.   
I began embracing life with new energy: I became the head of publicity in the Student Council; I founded my own club; I stepped onto the stage to perform; I ran with everything I had at the sports meet; I started a Xiaohongshu account and poured my heart into creating content…  None of these were to prove anything to anyone. It was simply because I wanted to grow into someone more authentic, more alive.
Now, sometimes a light does shine softly onto me. Things I once longed for returned, but I suddenly realized that I no longer felt desperate for someone else’s light to shine on me. I’m living my life— and all I need is to illuminate myself, little by little.
One night when I was sixteen, I was chatting with a friend, feeling unusually relaxed—words flowed out of me with ease. Out of the blue, she looked at me and said, “You always seem so full of life.”
At that moment, something brushed lightly against my heart, not for the praise, but because her words made me suddenly realize— that girl who once tiptoed through conversations… had finally come alive.
I froze. A rush of emotions hit me—nervousness, excitement, joy, and a little disbelief.
A voice in my head whispered, “Really? Or did she really mean it?”
Before I could overthink, my body reacted. Hot tears fell. My throat tightened. I struggled to hold back the sobs.
I didn’t know where those emotions came from—
maybe from a corner of my heart where the shadow of being abandoned had never truly left.
But at that moment, I suddenly felt that I was different from the girl who cried in my mother’s arms years ago.
I still don’t really know what kind of person I’ve become, and I still don’t fully understand what “be your own light” means.
But my life, quietly and gradually, has given that sentence a meaning of its own.
Maybe a light has begun to glow inside me.
Not as dazzling as the sun, but it’s strong enough to quietly illuminate me— and be the source of my strength.	
I’m no longer afraid of being alone.
I no longer doubt myself when someone leaves.
Because I finally understand:
That warm feeling of standing in the light doesn’t come from trying to please others or begging to be seen— it grows quietly from the moments when I learn to see myself.
And today, I’d like to—quite irresponsibly—pass these words on to you: Be your own light！
You don’t need to be the brightest light in the world.
You only need to shine brightly enough to illuminate your own path.
And I hope you can give this sentence your own meaning.
