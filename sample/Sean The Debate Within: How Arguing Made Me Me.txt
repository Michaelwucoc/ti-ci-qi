I have spent years arguing or debating— but not just with others. Also, with myself.

I bet you have too— every single one of you. That voice in your head—the one that weighs the pros and cons, rehearses difficult conversations, and second-guesses when you're making a big decision. For me, that internal voice didn’t show up in quiet self-reflection— it showed up in the noisy, competitive world of debate. For a long time, I thought debate was only about winning, about proving someone else wrong and convincing others that your argument is the better one.  But I’ve come to understand that debate isn’t just about those things. Even more, it’s about discovering who you are, and who we are as human beings.

The way we argue, the way we question, and the way we defend our ideas shape our identity and our future.

Let me ask you a question. A simple one. Are you happy recently? Think about that, and we will pick it up later.

The moment this idea popped up for me wasn't on a national stage, but in a quiet room alone. I was preparing for a tournament, and the resolution was: “This House Believes that following a pre-determined, practical career path is more valuable than pursuing a passionate, uncertain one.”

On paper, it was just another topic, but it ended up meaning way more to me than I expected. You see, my parents had built a secure life from scratch, and their definition of success was clear and tangible. My own future and dream, however, were never decided; I didn’t know if the path I was willing to pursue would be definite. This topic offered me a rare opportunity for self-discovery—to ask myself, which future am I truly inclined to pursue?

The tournament format required me to argue both sides. So first, I had to build the case for the practical path. It was easy. Incredibly easy. I spoke about student debt, about providing for a family, about the dignity of being someone others could rely on. These weren't just debate arguments— they were actual goals that I might have for the future.

But then came the real challenge: I had to switch sides. I had to argue for passion. For uncertainty. As I started researching, something unexpected happened. I came across a study about "parallel careers"— people who keep a practical job while slowly and steadily building their passion on the side. This wasn't an all-or-nothing choice. I could be both responsible and daring. The more I argued for this side, the more I realized I wasn’t just gathering arguments and evidence for a competition— I was building a blueprint for my real life. For the first time, I understood what it meant to actually plan for a future.

That's when it hit me. The debate wasn’t happening on paper anymore— it had moved into my mind. The most important round didn’t happen in that tournament. It happened afterward, and it’s a debate I’ve been stuck in ever since. Every decision we make, in school or in life, is for a future we’re constantly shaping through our choices. And to me, it’s a choice between all the different possible lifestyles I might grow into.

And that wasn’t the only way that debates shaped how I think and act. They made me calmer and more deliberate, even with small decisions, because I’d learned to hold competing truths without losing my balance. It made me steadier, because I realized that the strongest positions are always the ones tested from every angle.

The truth is, because of the way we human beings are wired, we’re always in a quiet debate with ourselves—who we were, who we are, and who we’re becoming.  

So the next time that voice in your head starts a debate—when you're weighing a big decision, or even just wondering if you're happy— don’t rush to shut it down. Don’t force a single, simple answer. Embrace the complexity. Welcome the contradictions that come with it. Because in that space between ‘for’ and ‘against,’ between ‘past,’ ‘now,’ and ‘then’—in that messy, uncertain, and profoundly in-between space— that’s where you might just discover who you were, who you are, and who you will be.
